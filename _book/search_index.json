When this occurs, they are no longer able to use multiple regression, as they would be violating the independent observations assumption, and may instead turn to multilevel modeling. With multilevel modeling, a researcher is able to handle students nested in schools and patients nested in nurses, as well as longitudinal models where time points are nested within individuals. However, a key facet to all of these models is the strict hierarchical nature of the data: each level one unit (students, patients, or time points) is nested within one, and only one, level 2 unit (school, nurse, individual). If we were to draw this relationship, it would look like Figure 1: there are no lines that are crossed, and each level one unit is associated with only one level two unit. This can also be represented in table form; a true hierarchical model will only have one row (cite rr thingmaybe LEMMA thing?). (#tab:true hierarchical table)Data distribution indicating a true hierarchical model student Math_Teacher_1 Math_Teacher_2 Math_Teacher_3 student 1, 2 3, 4 5, 6 Two level strict hierarchical models can be written as two separate equations, each representing a level of the model. \\[y_{ij} = \\beta_{0j} + r_{ij}\\] \\[\\beta_{0j} = \\gamma_{00} + u_{0j}\\], With these equations, \\(y_{ij}\\) is outcome and \\(\\beta_{0j}\\) represents intercepts. In the intercept-only model presented, there are no slope components, but if we were to add in predictors, we could examine how slopes vary. \\(r_{ij}\\) is the random variation in level one, while \\(u_{0j}\\) is random variation in level 2 (Raudenbush &amp; Bryk, 2002; Snijders &amp; Bosker, 2012). 2.1 Cross-classified vs. Multiple membership models Cross-classified models can also be represented in table or visual form. In table form, the cross classified structure becomes evident when there are level one units in more than one row and column.

As with the other diagrams, however, these can quickly become visually confusing with large datasets. 2.2 A note on Notation There are three possibilities for how to depict these models, each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages. Standard hierarchical notation, which we are familiar with from truly hierarchical models, uses subscripts to identify individual and cluster level predictors and effects. The disadvantage of this notation is that, due to its familiarity, individuals may incorrectly assume that unit \\(\\textit{i}\\) is strictly nested within cluster \\(\\textit{j}\\), which is not the case (Raudenbush &amp; Bryk, 2002; Leckie, 2013). Another method is to use multiple subscript notation (Beretvas, 2010). This notation makes the non-hierarchical structure more apparent, however, it can quickly become challenging to read. The notation we will use moving forward is classification notation (Leckie, 2013): \\[y_{i} = \\beta_{0} + \\sum_{j \\in school(i)}w_{j,i}^{(2)}u_{j}^{(2)} + e_{i}\\] \\[u_{j}^{(2)} \\sim N(0, \\sigma_{u(2)}^{2})\\] \\[e_{i}^{(2)} \\sim N(0, \\sigma_{e}^{2})\\] With this notation, the multiple membership component is represented by \\(\\sum_{j \\in school(i)}w_{j,i}^{(2)}u_{j}^{(2)}\\), which represents the weighted (\\(w_{j,i}^{(2)}\\)) cluster effects (\\(u_{j}^{(2)}\\)). The weight component represents the amount of time unit \\(\\textit{i}\\) spent in cluster \\(\\textit{j}\\), with the superscript (2) representing this is associated with the second level. All levels in the model are indicated, with level 1 (1) being implicit. The superscripts/subscripts for each level will identify to which level the random effects, variance parameters, and covariance parameters are associated with.
