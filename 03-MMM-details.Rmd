# Multiple Membership models: the details

The key feature of a multiple membership model is that level 1 units do not belong to one and only one level 2 cluster.  There may be some units that exhibit true hierarchy, but there are others that are 'multiple members': they belong to 2 or more clusters.  A classic example of this is mobile students in educational settings (eg. @Chung2012; Heck et. al., 2022; Leroux, 2018).  Another example in the health care setting is patient outcomes, but each patient frequently sees more than one nurse [@Leckie2013].  Using a multiple membership model allows the influence of multiple level 2 clusters to be taken into account.  Additionally, just like ignoring hierarchical data violates the independent observations assumption and cause an inflated type I error rate, ignoring a multiple membership structure of your data will also cause an inflated type I error rate.

## Weights
Weights are assigned to the level two clusters to reflect the different influences, and sum to one for any given level 1 unit.  These are decided by the researcher, who may take one of several approaches.  One approach is to assign equal weights, regardless of time.  This is the approach taken in the example dataset for this tutorial: it was assumed that each teacher seen by a student had equal influence, and the dataset was designed in such a way that students did not see any given teacher more than once.  In a mobile student situation, it may be that if a student attended a school for any length of time, that school would be given an equal weight to all the other schools attended by the student, even if they attended other schools for longer.  Another approach is to account for length of time.  In the previous example, if a student spent 1 year at school 1 but 2 years at school two, a reseacher may weight school one as 0.33 and school 2 as 0.67.  This will take into account the fact that since the student spent more time at school 2, it likely had a larger impact.  A third approach seen is weighting later educational settings more heavily than earlier ones, to reflect the fact that the more recent education may have a larger impact on test scores (for example) than earlier education [@Chung2012].

These weights are used both to identify amount of belonging to a particular level 2 cluster, but also to appropriately weight any level 2 predictors.
