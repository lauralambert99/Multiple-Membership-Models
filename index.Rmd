description: This is work done for a final project at JMU for the PSYC836 Hierarchical Linear Models course taught by Dr. Dena Pastor.  It is intended to give a brief introduction to multiple membership multilevel models as well as a walkthrough of how to run such a model using the R2MLwiN package to interface with the MLwiN software.

# About
This is a fictional scenario and data set designed for the sole purpose of illustrating the coding and interpretation of multiple membership models using the R2MLwiN package.  These data were simulated by myself, and were designed to loosely resemble a population of students at JMU.  These data were not actually gathered from JMU students.  This is designed to be tutorial-style, with background information about the models presented prior to walking through model building and output interpretation.

## R packages used 
```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown', 'R2MLwiN', 'tidyverse', 'ggplot2', 'misty'
), 'packages.bib')
```

Calculations and data manipulations performed in this tutorial made use of the following R packages:
Bookdown (@R-bookdown)  
knitr (@R-knitr)  
Rmarkdown (@R-rmarkdown)  
Tidyverse (@R-tidyverse)  
ggplot2 (@R-ggplot2)  
misty (@R-misty)
R2MLwiN (@R-R2MLwiN)  

The software MLwiN, v3.06 [@MLwiN] was also used, with Bayesian MCMC estimation [@MCMC2022]

## Acknowledgements 
Much of the background information about multiple membership models was gathered from the learning resources provided by the University of Bristol's Center for Multilevel Modelling (@LEMMA).

## A Disclaimer
The data used in this tutorial were simulated by me, and I am certain that a better job could have been done to better reflect some dependencies that should be in the data.  One known omission is variance components were not specified prior to estimating the outcome.  However, these data were simulated to reflect a student population at JMU to the best of my ability at the time and no intentional errors or misrepresentations were intended.  Data-generating code is included in the Appendix.
